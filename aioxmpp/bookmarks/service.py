class BookmarkClient(service.Service):
    """
    Supports retrieval and storage of bookmarks on the server.
    It currently only supports :xep:`Private XML Storage <49>` as
    backend.

    There is the general rule *never* to modify the bookmark instances
    retrieved from this class (either by :meth:`get_bookmarks` or as
    an argument to one of the signals). If you need to modify a bookmark
    for use with :meth:`update_bookmark` use :func:`copy.copy` to create
    a copy.

    .. automethod:: sync

    .. automethod:: get_bookmarks

    .. automethod:: set_bookmarks

    The following methods change the bookmark list in a get-modify-set
    pattern, to mitigate the danger of race conditions and should be
    used in most circumstances:

    .. automethod:: add_bookmark

    .. automethod:: remove_bookmark

    .. automethod:: update_bookmark


    The following signals are provided that allow tracking the changes to
    the bookmark list:

    .. signal:: on_bookmark_added(added_bookmark)

        Fires when a new bookmark is added.

    .. signal:: on_bookmark_removed(removed_bookmark)

        Fires when a bookmark is removed.

    .. signal:: on_bookmark_changed(old_bookmark, new_bookmark)

        Fires when a bookmark is changed.

    .. note:: A heuristic is used to determine the change of bookmarks
              and the reported changes may not directly reflect the
              used methods, but it will always be possible to
              construct the list of bookmarks from the events. For
              example, when using :meth:`update_bookmark` to change
              the JID of a :class:`Conference` bookmark a removed and
              a added signal will fire.

    .. note:: The bookmark protocol is prone to race conditions if
              several clients access it concurrently. Be careful to
              use a get-modify-set pattern or the provided highlevel
              interface.

    .. note:: Some other clients extend the bookmark format. For now
              those extensions are silently dropped by our XSOs, and
              therefore are lost, when changing the bookmarks with
              aioxmpp. This is considered a bug to be fixed in the future.
