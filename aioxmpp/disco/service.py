    A service implementing XEP-0030. The service provides methods for managing
    the own features and identities as well as querying others features and
    identities.

    Querying other entitiesâ€™ service discovery information:

    .. automethod:: query_info

    Managing identities:

    .. automethod:: register_identity

    .. automethod:: unregister_identity

    .. note::

       While no other identity is registered, a default identity is used. That
       default identity has a category ``"client"``, a type ``"bot"`` and a
       name referring to the :mod:`aioxmpp` library.

    Managing features:

    .. automethod:: register_feature

    .. automethod:: unregister_feature

    .. note::

       The features which are mandatory per XEP-0030 are always registered and
       cannot be unregistered. For the purpose of unregistration, they behave
       as if they had never been registered; for the purpose of registration,
       they behave as if they had been registered before.
