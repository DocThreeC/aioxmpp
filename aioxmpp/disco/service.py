class Identity:
    """
    A handle to a specific identity represented in a :class:`Service`. It is
    returned by :meth:`Service.register_identity` and can be used to
    comfortably manage different names for an identity.

    .. attribute:: default_name

       The default name of the identity. This must either be a :class:`str` or
       :data:`None`.

       It is used as value for the ``name`` attribute whenever the
       :attr:`names` dictionary is empty.

    .. attribute:: names

       A :class:`.structs.LanguageMap` mapping. For each entry, a language tag
       is created, with the ``lang`` attribute set to the key of the entry and
       the ``name`` attribute set to the value.

       .. warning::

          Care must be taken when using the :data:`None` key. Technically, if
          :data:`None` is used and the parents ``xml:lang`` value is equal to
          one of the other keys in the mapping, the output will be invalid. The
          service cannot check against that as the parent ``xml:lang`` values
          are not known.

          In general, using the :data:`None` key is discouraged; just do not do
          it to avoid problems. Use :attr:`default_name` instead.

    .. warning::

       Do not confuse this class with :class:`aioxmpp.disco.xso.Identity`.
