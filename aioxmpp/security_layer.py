:mod:`~aioxmpp.security_layer` --- Implementations to negotiate stream security
####################################################################################

This module provides different implementations of the security layer
(TLS+SASL).

These are coupled, as different SASL features might need different TLS features
(such as channel binding or client cert authentication).

.. autofunction:: tls_with_password_based_authentication(password_provider, [ssl_context_factory], [max_auth_attempts=3])

.. autofunction:: security_layer

.. autofunction:: negotiate_stream_security

Certificate verifiers
=====================

To verify the peer certificate provided by the server, different
:class:`CertificateVerifier`s are available:

.. autoclass:: PKIXCertificateVerifier

To implement your own verifiers, see the documentation at the base class for
certificate verifiers:

.. autoclass:: CertificateVerifier

Partial security providers
==========================

Partial security providers serve as arguments to pass to
:func:`negotiate_stream_security`.

.. _tls providers:

Transport layer security provider
---------------------------------

As an `tls_provider` argument to :class:`SecurityLayer`, instances of the
following classes can be used:

.. autoclass:: STARTTLSProvider

.. _sasl providers:

SASL providers
--------------

As elements of the `sasl_providers` argument to :class:`SecurityLayer`,
instances of the following classes can be used:

.. autoclass:: PasswordSASLProvider

Abstract base classes
=====================

For implementation of custom SASL providers, the following base class can be
used:

.. autoclass:: SASLProvider

class HookablePKIXCertificateVerifier(CertificateVerifier):
    """
    This PKIX-based verifier has several hooks which allow overriding of the
    checking process, for example to implement key or certificate pinning.

    It provides three callbacks:

    * `quick_check` is a synchronous callback (and must be a plain function)
      which is called from :meth:`verify_callback`. It is only called if the
      certificate fails full PKIX verification, and only for certain cases. For
      example, expired certificates do not get a second chance and are rejected
      immediately.

      It is called with the leaf certificate as its only argument. It must
      return :data:`True` if the certificate is known good and should pass the
      verification. If the certificate is known bad and should fail the
      verification immediately, it must return :data:`False`.

      If the certificate is unknown and the check should be deferred to the
      `post_handshake_deferred_failure` callback, :data:`None` must be
      returned.

    * `post_handshake_deferred_failure` must be a coroutine. It is called after
      the handshake is done but before the STARTTLS negotiation has finished
      and allows the application to take more time to decide on a certificate
      and possibly request user input.

      The coroutine receives the verifier instance as its argument and can make
      use of all the verification attributes to present the user with a
      sensible choice.

    * `post_handshake_success` is only called if the certificate has passed the
      verification (either because it flawlessly passed by OpenSSL or the
      `quick_check` callback returned :data:`True`).

    The following attributes are available when the post handshake callbacks
    are called:

    .. attribute:: recorded_errors

       This is a :class:`set` with tuples consisting of a
       :class:`OpenSSL.crypto.X509` instance, an OpenSSL error number and the
       depth of the certificate in the verification chain (0 is the leaf
       certificate).

       It is a collection of all errors which were passed into
       :meth:`verify_callback` by OpenSSL.

    .. attribute:: hostname_matches

       This is :data:`True` if the host name in the leaf certificate matches
       the domain part of the JID for which we are connecting (i.e. the usual
       server name check).

    .. attribute:: leaf_x509

       The :class:`OpenSSL.crypto.X509` object which represents the leaf
       certificate.

    Negotiate stream security for the given `xmlstream`. For this to work,
    `features` must be the most recent
    :class:`.stream_elements.StreamFeatures` node.

    First, transport layer security is negotiated using `tls_provider`. If that
    fails non-fatally, negotiation continues as normal. Exceptions propagate
    upwards.

    After TLS has been tried, SASL is negotiated, by sequentially attempting
    SASL negotiation using the providers in the `sasl_providers` list. If a
    provider fails to negotiate SASL with an
    :class:`~.errors.AuthenticationFailure` or has no mechanisms in common with
    the peer server, the next provider can continue. Otherwise, the exception
    propagates upwards.

    If no provider succeeds and there was an authentication failure, that error
    is re-raised. Otherwise, a dedicated :class:`~.errors.SASLFailure`
    exception is raised, which states that no common mechanisms were found.

    On success, a pair of ``(tls_transport, features)`` is returned. If TLS has
    been negotiated, `tls_transport` is the SSL :class:`asyncio.Transport`
    created by asyncio (as returned by the `tls_provider`). If no TLS has been
    negotiated, `tls_transport` is :data:`None`. `features` is the latest
    :class:`~.stream_elements.StreamFeatures` element received during
    negotiation.

    On failure, an appropriate exception is raised. Authentication failures
    can be caught as :class:`.errors.AuthenticationFailure`. Errors related
    to SASL or TLS negotiation itself can be caught using
    :class:`~.errors.SASLFailure` and :class:`~.errors.TLSFailure`
    respectively.
