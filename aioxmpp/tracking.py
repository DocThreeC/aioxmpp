:mod:`~aioxmpp.tracking` --- Interfaces for high-level message tracking
#######################################################################

This submodule provides interfaces for tracking messages to the recipient. The
actual tracking is not implemented here.

.. versionadded:: 0.5

   This module was added in version 0.5.

.. versionchanged:: 0.9

   This module was completely rewritten in 0.9.

.. seealso::

   Method :meth:`~.muc.Room.send_tracked_message`
     implements tracking for messages sent through a MUC.

General Remarks about Tracking and Memory Consumption
=====================================================


Tracking stanzas costs memory. There are basically two options on how to
implement the management of additional information:

1. Either the tracking stops when the :class:`MessageTracker` is released (i.e.
   the last reference to it gets collected).

2. Or the tracking is stopped explicitly by the user.

Option (1) has the appeal that users (applications) do not have to worry about
properly releasing the tracking objects. However, it has the downside that
applications have to keep the :class:`MessageeTracker` instance around. Remember
that connecting to callbacks of an object is *not* enough to keep it alive.

Option (2) is somewhat like file objects work: in theory, you have to close
them explicitly and manually: if you do not, there is no guarantee when the
file is actually closed. It is thus a somewhat known Python idiom, and also is
more explicit. And it doesnâ€™t break callbacks.

The implementation of :class:`MessageTracker` uses **Option 2**. So you have to
:meth:`MessageTracker.close` all :class:`MessageTracker` objects to ensure that
all tracking resources associated with it are released; this stops any tracking
which is still in progress.

It is strongly recommended that you close message trackers after a timeout. You
can use :meth:`MessageTracker.set_timeout` for that, or manually call
:meth:`MessageTracker.close` as desired.

class MessageState(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration of possible states for :class:`MessageTracker`. These states
    are used to inform using code about the delivery state of a message. See
    :class:`MessageTracker` for details.

    .. attribute:: ABORTED

       The message has been aborted or dropped in the :class:`~.StanzaStream`
       queues. See :class:`~.StanzaToken` and :attr:`MessageTracker.token`.

       This is a final state.

    .. attribute:: ERROR

       An error reply stanza has been received for the stanza which was sent.

       This is, in most cases, a final state.

    .. attribute:: IN_TRANSIT

       The message is still queued for sending or has been sent to the peer
       server without stream management.

       Depending on the tracking implementation, this may be a final state.

    .. attribute:: DELIVERED_TO_SERVER

       The message has been delivered to the server and the server acked the
       delivery using stream management.

       Depending on the tracking implementation, this may be a final state.

       The message has been delivered to the recipient.

       Depending on the tracking implementation, this may be a final state.

class MessageTracker:
    """
    This is the high-level equivalent of the :class:`~.StanzaToken`.

    This structure is used by different tracking implementations. The interface
    of this class is split in two parts:

    1. The public interface for use by applications.
    2. The "protected" interface for use by tracking implementations.

    :class:`MessageTracker` objects are designed to be drivable from multiple
    tracking implementations at once. The idea is that different tracking
    implementations can cover different parts of the path a stanza takes: one
    can cover the path to the server (by hooking into the events of a
    :class:`~.StanzaToken`), the other implementation can use e.g. :xep:`184` to
    determine delivery at the target and so on.

    Methods and attributes from the "protected" interface are marked by a
    leading underscore.
