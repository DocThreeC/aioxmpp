On API stability
################

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
section are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119`__.

Up to version 1.0
=================

Up to version 1.0, the API inside the :mod:`aioxmpp` package MAY change without
notice in advance. These changes MAY break code in ways which makes it
impossible to have code which works with both the old and the new version.

Changes to the public, non-plugin API SHOULD NOT break code in a way which
makes it impossible to use with old and new versions.

The :ref:`changelog` may not be complete, but SHOULD contain all changes which
break existing code.

The below text, which describes the behaviour for versions from 1.0 onwards,
MAY change without notice in advance.

From version 1.0 onwards
========================

Still to be done.
