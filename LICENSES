Licenses
========

The whole ``aioxmpp`` is distributed under the GPLv3. See ``COPYING.gpl3`` for
the full license text.

An exception is made for the ``aioxmpp/ssl_transport.py``, which is
substantially based on the ``_SelectorSslTransport`` class found in the
[asyncio package][1] (at the time of writing, in ``selector_events.py``). The
[asyncio][1] package is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license (see
``COPYING.apache20``), and permission is granted to use
``aioxmpp/ssl_transport.py`` under the very same license.
