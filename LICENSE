=======

The license under which asyncio_xmpp is distributed is still unclear. For now,
no licensing takes place.

However, ``asyncio_xmpp/ssl_transport.py`` is merely a modified version of a
class found in the [asyncio package found on PyPI][1], which is licensed
under Apache 2.0. Thus, ssl_transport.py itself is also under Apache 2.0, of
which a full copy can be found in ``COPYING.apache2.0``.
